# Agentic Loop Workflow Roadmap

Date: 2026-06-24

## Done

- Accepted the product direction that `frontdesk` should be reduced to user
  interaction, macro-task intake, confirmations, final reporting, and
  unrecoverable escalation.
- Accepted the Trellis-inspired principle that workflow state should live in
  external files and be advanced through scripts, not through one agent's
  conversation memory.
- Accepted the Team Builder-inspired principle that teams, roles, handoffs,
  termination conditions, and escalation rules should be declarative workflow
  objects.
- Accepted the simple-kernel/flexible-agent principle: workflow programs
  should stay small, stable, deterministic, and recoverable, while agents
  handle semantic planning, review, diagnosis, and complex documents. Scripts
  commit or reject agent artifacts through hard constraints rather than trying
  to encode all intelligence.
- Recorded the initial role split: `frontdesk`, planner group, plan steward, loop
  runner, orchestrator, execution nodes, inner monitor, recovery, and
  plan-tree synchronization.
- Accepted the non-goal that CCB should not copy Trellis' implicit subagent
  flow. CCB should use explicit, visible, inspectable agents and CCB-owned
  communication state.
- Accepted the context-purity principle: multi-agent workflow value comes from
  high-quality responsibility and granularity boundaries, not from agent count.
  Short-term, fast-changing execution detail should be assigned to short-lived
  workers or runtime artifacts and cleared after use; `frontdesk` and durable
  plan-tree documents should carry only macro intent, decisions, blockers, and
  evidence.
- Accepted the naming correction from `main` to `frontdesk`: the user-facing
  group is an intake/reporting boundary, not a primary authority or strongest
  agent. The name must discourage implementation, state mutation, and hidden
  orchestration behavior.
- Accepted the stage-batched clarification model: planner produces candidate
  questions for the current phase, a broker filters, merges, defaults, defers,
  or marks them obsolete, and `frontdesk` only presents curated user-facing
  question artifacts. The broker should not be a long-lived heavy-context role;
  persistent state is the question queue and runtime artifacts, while semantic
  broker work can be launched with fresh context per phase batch.
- Accepted the v1 execution-node model: default nodes are flat
  `worker + checker` units. Checker is an independent quality gate that designs
  node-level verification and rejects hidden fallback, degradation, scope
  shrinkage, or false success. Complex node-internal teams are deferred.
- Accepted partial branch semantics: non-converged nodes freeze only their
  dependent branch when safe, unrelated sibling work drains, and planner
  receives a partial package instead of allowing loop-local degradation.
- Accepted round-level verification: planner defines the verification contract,
  orchestrator summarizes actual node/dependency state, and round checker
  designs and executes the concrete whole-round verification plan.
- Accepted the plan/runtime state split: durable task packets live under
  `docs/plantree/plans/<plan-slug>/tasks/<task-id>/`, runtime loop lists live
  under `.ccb/runtime/loops/`, and scripts own all authoritative status,
  index, phase, owner, node, branch, ask, and round writes.
- Accepted the orchestrator boundary: it is an ask-activated semantic
  dispatcher that analyzes task complexity, chooses 1-4 nodes, slices work,
  constrains `ask` dispatch, requests runtime capacity, and aggregates results.
  It must not directly reload, unload, kill, or write runtime authority.
- Reviewed the `mother` role's orchestrator RolePack blueprint and accepted it
  as the V1 content plan for `agentroles.ccb_orchestrator`: single role,
  default local name `orchestrator`, six generic skills, seven templates,
  fixed-agent V1 operation, and explicit non-authority over reload, kill,
  provider sessions, runtime files, checker override, and partial-to-done
  conversion.
- Accepted the dynamic capacity direction: users declare allowed
  `loop.role_profiles` in config, including role, provider, model, thinking,
  workspace, max instances, and reuse policy; `orchestrator` uses a fixed
  `orchestrator-capacity` skill to call `ccb loop capacity
  ensure/status/release` by profile and count.
- Accepted the dynamic runtime layout direction: CCB should maintain logical
  tmux windows and panes for dynamic agents through a runtime layout manager.
  User-facing `frontend` and dialog experts live in `frontdesk-dialog`;
  planner/broker/orchestrator/round checker live in `plan-orchestrate`;
  each execution node receives its own `node-<loop-id>-<node-id>` window; and
  diagnostics live in `runtime`.
- Landed the first deterministic pane-growth slice in the current worktree:
  `ccb layout plan` reports 1->6 pane layouts and overflow windows, while
  `ccb layout smoke` creates placeholder panes in an isolated tmux session.
  Verified from `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2` with
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/ccb_test` for pane counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
  7, and 8; 7 panes produced `frontdesk-dialog` with six panes plus
  `frontdesk-dialog-2` with one pane, 8 panes produced a second window with two
  panes, and smoke cleanup succeeded each run.
- Accepted the dynamic release/shrink direction: dynamic agent exit should close
  only the released idle target pane, compact remaining panes through tmux
  move/resize operations, remove empty overflow windows, and retain busy agents
  without layout mutation. See
  [goals/dynamic-pane-shrink-release-goal.md](goals/dynamic-pane-shrink-release-goal.md).
- Accepted the dynamic lifecycle direction: long-lived interactive roles such
  as frontend, planner, and orchestrator default to `hide` or `park`, while
  short-lived worker/checker roles can unload only after evidence import and
  idle checks. See
  [topics/dynamic-agent-lifecycle-and-skills.md](topics/dynamic-agent-lifecycle-and-skills.md)
  and
  [decisions/012-long-lived-roles-park-before-unload.md](decisions/012-long-lived-roles-park-before-unload.md).
- Landed the first continuous dynamic layout smoke in the current worktree:
  `ccb layout dynamic-smoke` grows fake-agent panes in one isolated tmux session
  and then shrinks them. Verified from `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2` with
  source `ccb_test` for `1->6->1` and `1->8->1`; all retained panes stayed
  alive, `frontdesk-dialog-2` was added at overflow and removed when shrinking
  back to six, and cleanup succeeded.
- Landed a repeatable source-wrapper dynamic layout smoke script in the current
  worktree: `scripts/dynamic_layout_smoke.py` prepares isolated fake-provider
  projects, proves multi-node `worker + code_reviewer` windows can be loaded,
  reached by `ask`, drained, and released, and proves same-window middle-pane
  removal preserves surviving agent panes. Verified in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/dynamic-layout-smoke-1782565-*` with source
  `ccb_test`; both flows returned `dynamic_layout_smoke_status=ok` and cleanup
  reached `kill_status: ok`.
- Accepted the planner authority boundary: planner group owns semantic
  requirements, acceptance criteria, verification contract, risk notes, and
  readiness recommendations; `ccb plan` scripts own authoritative task status,
  indexes, imported artifact records, and current-loop bindings.
- Accepted the first plan-update landing direction: implement a narrow
  `ccb plan task-create/task-artifact/task-status/task-show/task-list/breadcrumb`
  slice before allowing autonomous planner-to-loop handoff.
- Landed the first `ccb plan` task-packet command surface in the current
  worktree. It creates durable task packets, imports planner artifacts with
  digest metadata, enforces review before `ready`, renders breadcrumb handoff
  text, and was externally smoke-tested through
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/ccb_test` in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/plan-task-smoke-v1`.
- Accepted the round-checker separation model: `round_checker` remains an
  independent post-round verifier, while planner rehydrates next-loop planning
  from task packet and round evidence instead of retained conversation memory.
- Extended the current `ccb loop run-once` slice to include a fixed
  `round_checker` ask after orchestrator aggregation.
- Ran an external fake-provider end-to-end smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/agentic-loop-full-smoke-v1`: planner task packet
  reached `ready`, loop `loopfull2` completed worker/reviewer/orchestrator/
  round_checker asks, dynamic worker/reviewer nodes were released, round
  checker evidence was imported as `completion`, and the task reached `done`.
- Accepted the full workflow-loop model: planner is a workflow-loop phase but
  not part of the execution round; loop runner reads document/runtime state,
  activates planner or execution roles, and stops on terminal, paused, or
  limit states. See
  [topics/complete-workflow-design.md](topics/complete-workflow-design.md) and
  [decisions/009-loop-runner-activates-planner-and-stops.md](decisions/009-loop-runner-activates-planner-and-stops.md).
- Completed a reviewer/coworker readiness review for the workflow-loop design.
  Accepted the required pre-implementation clarifications: round writeback must
  be idempotent and consistency-checked, `rework_node` must escalate to
  `partial` or `replan_required` when bounded repair no longer applies, and
  the next implementation should be a one-shot `loop runner --once` bridge
  instead of a daemon.
- Landed and verified
  [goals/loop-runner-bridge-goal.md](goals/loop-runner-bridge-goal.md) in the
  current worktree. The bridge now supports `task-bind-loop`,
  `task-import-round`, `loop run-once --task-id`, and
  `loop runner --once`; focused tests passed with `21 passed`, neighboring
  CLI/router/render tests passed with `102 passed`, touched CLI modules passed
  `py_compile`, and an external source-wrapper fake-provider smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/loop-runner-bridge-smoke-1782493619` proved
  ready-task binding, one round execution, round result import, current-loop
  cleanup, and generated worker/reviewer release. The smoke intentionally
  imported `round_blocker` when fake `round_checker` output lacked an explicit
  machine result, preserving the rule that scripts must not infer semantic
  `pass`.
- Completed the first `mother` RolePack design pass for the workflow role
  catalog. Accepted P0 complete RolePack work for `ccb_planner`,
  `ccb_plan_reviewer`, `ccb_clarification_broker`, `ccb_orchestrator`, and
  `ccb_round_checker`; P1 simplified roles for `frontdesk`, `worker`, and
  `checker`; and P2 boundary-only roles for risk, monitor, recovery, plan
  steward, domain researcher, and spec checker. See
  [history/mother-rolepack-design-2026-06-27.md](history/mother-rolepack-design-2026-06-27.md).
- Landed the first workflow RolePack draft set in the current worktree:
  shared authority rule and artifact templates, P0 RolePacks for
  `agentroles.ccb_planner`, `agentroles.ccb_plan_reviewer`,
  `agentroles.ccb_clarification_broker`, tightened
  `agentroles.ccb_orchestrator`, `agentroles.ccb_round_checker`, and P1
  simplified RolePacks for `agentroles.ccb_frontdesk`,
  `agentroles.ccb_worker`, and `agentroles.ccb_checker`. Targeted verification
  passed with `PYTHONPATH=lib pytest -q test/test_orchestrator_rolepack.py`
  producing `7 passed`.
- Landed the first workflow runner state-router slice in the current
  worktree. `ccb plan` artifact imports now record actor/job provenance;
  `ccb loop runner --once` routes `ready` to the existing execution bridge,
  routes `draft`/`partial`/`replan_required` to one planner activation packet
  and ask, and stops without provider activation for
  `needs_clarification`/`blocked`/terminal states. Focused tests passed with
  `34 passed`; source-wrapper smokes in `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2` covered
  draft planner activation, paused clarification stop, and ready execution
  bridge behavior with fake providers. See
  [history/workflow-runner-state-router-2026-06-27.md](history/workflow-runner-state-router-2026-06-27.md).

## In Progress

- Shape the first architecture contract for a state-machine-driven agentic
  loop that separates user-facing interaction, planning, orchestration,
  execution, monitoring, recovery, and plan-tree maintenance.
- Drive the first implementation goal for
  [dynamic orchestrator capacity](goals/orchestrator-dynamic-capacity-goal.md):
  `loop.role_profiles`, `orchestrator-capacity`, dynamic
  `worker + code_reviewer` load/release, task dispatch, review, aggregation,
  and real `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2` validation.
- First config slice is implemented in the current worktree: project config can
  parse, validate, record, and render `loop.capacity` and
  `loop.role_profiles`; focused config-loader tests pass.
- First command/state slice is implemented in the current worktree:
  `ccb loop capacity ensure/status/release --json` writes and reads
  deterministic loop capacity state under `.ccb/runtime/loops` through the
  existing runtime-state path layout.
- Runtime overlay slice is implemented in the current worktree: active
  `capacity.json` records are merged into config loading, user
  `.ccb/ccb.config` is not rewritten, and ensure/release tries guarded reload
  when a daemon is mounted or defers materialization until next start when
  unmounted.
- Orchestrator RolePack slice is implemented in draft form:
  `drafts/agentroles.ccb_orchestrator` includes `orchestrator-capacity`, CCB
  adapter memory, and worker/checker templates; focused tests prove manifest
  translation and skill projection.
- Mounted fake-provider runtime smoke passed in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/orchestrator-capacity-runtime-smoke`: dynamic
  `worker + code_reviewer` ensure applied through guarded reload, generated
  targets accepted ask/watch jobs, release removed idle nodes, and busy release
  retained a running worker until terminal completion.
- Deterministic `ccb loop run-once` slice is implemented and tested: it ensures
  one worker/reviewer pair, dispatches worker/reviewer/orchestrator ask/watch
  jobs, dispatches a fixed `round_checker` ask, releases idle generated nodes,
  and writes `round.json`, `asks.jsonl`, `events.jsonl`, `breadcrumb.md`, and
  reply artifacts. Execution/release failures after live capacity are recorded
  in `round.json` and keep the command non-ok while still attempting idle
  release.
- External fake-provider run-once smoke passed in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/orchestrator-capacity-runtime-smoke` with
  isolated `HOME`, `CCB_SOURCE_HOME`, and `AGENT_ROLES_STORE`; post-run `ps`
  showed only `orchestrator`.
- A guarded real-provider semantic-smoke harness now exists at
  `scripts/orchestrator_capacity_semantic_smoke.py`. Codex prepare/preflight
  passed under
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/orchestrator-capacity-real-provider-smoke`, and
  the generated project passed source `ccb_test config validate`. The harness
  refuses to start real providers unless `CCB_ORCH_SMOKE_RUN_REAL=1` is set.
- Planner role design is documented in
  [topics/planner-role-design.md](topics/planner-role-design.md): V1 starts
  with `planner + plan_reviewer`, batches clarification through broker, and
  produces draft task artifacts plus readiness recommendation.
- Plan-update script landing is implemented and documented in
  [topics/plan-update-script-landing.md](topics/plan-update-script-landing.md)
  and tracked by
  [goals/planner-plan-script-goal.md](goals/planner-plan-script-goal.md).
- Complete workflow design is documented in
  [topics/complete-workflow-design.md](topics/complete-workflow-design.md):
  it defines nested workflow/execution loops, planner activation triggers,
  round result routing, stop conditions, authority ownership, and V1 command
  gaps.
- The active follow-through implementation goal is now fixed in
  [goals/clarification-planner-followthrough-goal.md](goals/clarification-planner-followthrough-goal.md):
  add the V1 `ccb question` artifact surface and the planner/broker/frontdesk/
  reviewer path that can move a routed `draft`, `partial`, or
  `replan_required` task toward script-owned `ready`.
- Dynamic agent lifecycle and skill design is documented in
  [topics/dynamic-agent-lifecycle-and-skills.md](topics/dynamic-agent-lifecycle-and-skills.md):
  it defines lifecycle states, runtime records, profile-based and inline
  role-based `ccb agent add ...` syntax, policy-based `remove`, loop capacity
  policy extensions, and a generic `dynamic-agent-lifecycle` skill boundary.
- Landed the first generic dynamic agent lifecycle CLI slice in the current
  worktree:
  `ccb agent status/show/add/remove --json`, runtime lifecycle records under
  `.ccb/runtime/agents`, dynamic-agent config overlay, profile-based add,
  inline `name:provider --role ...` add, policy-based remove, and kill safety
  validation. Focused tests passed, and external source-wrapper smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/agent-lifecycle-real.o4yC4g` proved:
  add while unmounted, config overlay includes `helper`, startup mounts
  `main + helper`, `ask helper` completes through fake provider, `kill -f`
  unmounts, `remove --policy unload --idle-only` removes the overlay, and
  final `config validate` returns only `main`.
- Mounted reload analysis is now pinned: existing `ccb reload` already supports
  additive agent append from `ccb.config`, and the dynamic lifecycle overlay now
  has a matching reload-apply test proving it materializes a tmux pane before
  mounting runtime. External fake/fake-codex providers do not expose a preserved
  tmux pane anchor in `ps`, so they cannot prove online pane split; the CLI now
  reports the precise `namespace_patch_failed` anchor error instead of a generic
  reload failure.
- Landed the first true hot-load placement slice in the current worktree:
  `ccb agent add ... --window NAME` can append a new dynamic agent to an
  existing managed window or create a new managed window, `--window-class`
  chooses or creates a class window, and `--loop-id/--node-id` places execution
  agents in `node-<loop-id>-<node-id>`. Runtime lifecycle records now include
  placement intent and applied pane/window evidence. Focused tests prove
  parser, dry-run reload plans, existing-window `add_agent`, and new-window
  `add_window`; controlled mounted tmux smokes in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/agent-hot-pane-ident.otr4SM` and
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/agent-hot-window-ident.Xj9dR6` proved the new
  agent mounts and accepts `ask` without changing preserved pane identity.
- Extended the true hot-load slice to cover safe dynamic unload:
  `remove --policy unload --idle-only` now records busy agents as
  `retained_busy`, applies the guarded `remove_agent` reload path after the
  target is idle, clears the active pane id while retaining `last_pane_id`,
  unloads runtime authority, removes the overlay from projected config, and
  removes empty dynamic windows. Focused tests passed, and controlled mounted
  tmux smokes in `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/agent-hot-remove-pty.2FIiGo` and
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/agent-hot-window-remove-pty.RqWVcE` proved
  existing-window and new-window release without breaking the preserved `main`
  pane.
- Landed the first safe `agent release` command surface and same-window dynamic
  cycle smoke. `ccb agent release <agent> --policy auto|hide|park|unload`
  avoids the destructive `kill` path; auto release unloads short-lived
  execution roles and parks unknown/long-lived roles. The mounted tmux cycle in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/agent-hot-cycle-pty.Tu9DCH` proved dynamic
  panes can grow from `1->6` and release back to `1` while preserving `%1:main`
  and returning `known_agents` to `['main']`.
- Landed the long-lived role park/resume slice. `ccb agent park <agent>` keeps
  the pane/runtime context but projects `dispatch_disabled=true`, publishes a
  config-only `view_only_change`, and causes direct `ask` dispatch to reject;
  `ccb agent resume <agent>` clears that dispatch gate without tmux mutation.
  Focused tests passed with `150 passed`, reload-focused tests passed with
  `70 passed`, and the mounted source-wrapper smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/hotload-smoke-1782474327` proved
  add/ask/park-reject/resume-ask/new-window-add/release cleanup end to end.
- Landed the first clarification follow-through slice in the current worktree.
  `ccb question` now imports candidate questions, broker/user question batches,
  raw answers, normalized answers, and status refs with schema/path/provenance
  checks. `user-batch-import` pauses draft tasks at `needs_clarification`,
  `normalized-import` returns answered tasks to `draft`, runner paused
  responses include question refs, and planner activation packets include
  compact question/answer refs. The runner also activates `plan_reviewer` when
  planner artifacts are present but review is missing, and the existing
  `ccb plan` ready guard rejects `ready` until review is imported. Focused
  tests passed with
  `PYTHONPATH=lib pytest -q test/test_question_cli.py` producing `7 passed`;
  neighboring plan/loop/rolepack tests passed with `34 passed`, and the
  combined targeted regression set passed with `41 passed`; external
  source-wrapper smoke passed in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/question-followthrough-smoke-1782531830`,
  with review guard smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/plan-review-guard-smoke-1782532093`.
- Completed the Clarification And Planner Follow-Through V1 goal in the
  current worktree. The full source-wrapper fake-provider smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/question-followthrough-e2e-smoke-1782532792`
  covered draft planner activation, question import, clarification pause, raw
  and normalized answers, planner reactivation with answer refs, planner
  artifact imports, plan reviewer activation, review-backed `ready`, and ready
  execution bridge. The final task status was `blocked` with
  `round_result_source=missing_round_checker_result`, preserving the invariant
  that scripts do not infer `pass` from fake provider text.
- Completed Workflow RolePack External Spec Handoff V1. The workflow role
  drafts were promoted into `/home/bfly/yunwei/agent-roles-spec` as installable
  catalog Roles for `frontdesk`, `planner`, `clarification_broker`,
  `plan_reviewer`, `orchestrator`, `worker`, `ccb_checker`, and
  `round_checker`. External tests passed with `69 passed`; CCB targeted tests
  passed with `37 passed`; source-wrapper smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/workflow-rolepack-handoff-smoke` installed all
  eight Roles, validated the five-role foreground config, planned dynamic
  worker/checker capacity, projected Codex `ask` plus role skills, and imported
  planner/broker/reviewer artifacts through `ccb plan` and `ccb question` until
  task `role-handoff-001` reached `ready`. The smoke also found and fixed the
  invalid `normalized-answers.jsonl` placeholder enum in both external Roles
  and local draft templates. CCB source now carries provider-local `ask` assets
  for the full workflow provider set, including Gemini, Qwen, and Z.ai.
- Completed the repeatable Workflow Closure Smoke goal in the current
  worktree. `scripts/workflow_closure_smoke.py` now prepares an isolated
  fake-provider source-wrapper project, installs the local workflow RolePacks,
  drives `ccb plan`, `ccb question`, and `ccb loop runner --once` through
  planner activation, clarification pause, normalized answers, planner
  reactivation, plan-reviewer gate, review-backed `ready`, execution bridge,
  round evidence import, and `release --policy auto` cleanup. Focused tests
  passed with `35 passed`; `git diff --check` and touched-file `py_compile`
  passed; external Agent Roles focused tests passed with `5 passed`; and the
  real smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/workflow-closure-smoke-178255c` returned
  `workflow_smoke_status: ok`, `release_policy: auto`, `retained_count: 0`,
  and no dynamic worker/checker in `ps`. The fake-provider final task status
  remains intentionally `blocked` with
  `round_result_source=missing_round_checker_result`.
- Landed the first read-only runtime layout status surface. `ccb layout status`
  and `ccb layout status --json` now report effective `[windows]` topology
  after dynamic overlays, configured vs dynamic agents, lifecycle state,
  runtime state, pane ids, namespace state, and best-effort tmux observations.
  Focused tests passed with `39 passed`, touched-file `py_compile` passed, and
  the source-wrapper smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/layout-status-real-1782553123` proved mounted
  explicit-window startup, same-window hot add/release, new-window
  add/release with empty-window removal, ask reachability for the dynamic fake
  agent, and unmounted stale-namespace status skipping tmux observation.
- Landed stable dynamic placement order for explicit `[windows]` hot load.
  Dynamic lifecycle records now carry `created_sequence`, semantic placement
  requests are resolved back into `resolved_window_name`, and config overlays
  order dynamic agents by creation instead of agent name. This fixed the real
  same execution-node failure where adding `checker1` after `worker1` was
  misclassified as `layout_change`; it now remains an append-only `add_agent`.
  Focused tests passed with `185 passed`, and the source-wrapper smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/layout-placement-real-1782555` proved class
  overflow to `plan-orchestrate-2`, execution node creation
  `node-round1-node1`, same-node `worker1, checker1` ordering, ask submission
  to `checker1`, reverse unload, empty dynamic-window removal, and final return
  to the two configured windows.
- Connected `ccb loop capacity` to the runtime layout placement model.
  Capacity-generated worker/checker agents now carry `loop_id`, `node_id`,
  `created_sequence`, and execution-node placement; explicit `[windows]`
  overlays materialize them in `node-<loop-id>-<node-id>` windows instead of
  appending them to the entry window. `layout status` now distinguishes
  `source=loop` agents and reports `loop_agent_count`, loop id, node id,
  profile, pane, and runtime state. Focused tests passed with `187 passed`,
  and the source-wrapper smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/loop-capacity-layout-real-1782557` proved
  mounted `loop capacity ensure` creates `node-round1-node1`, status reports
  two loop agents there, and `loop capacity release --idle-only` removes the
  node window and returns to `loop_agent_count=0`.
- Aligned orchestrator-facing RolePack and capacity documentation with the
  runtime layout model. `orchestrator-capacity` now states that
  `ccb loop capacity ensure/status/release` is the only dynamic execution
  capacity path, returned `node_id`/window/placement fields are CCB-owned
  evidence only, `ccb layout status --json` is read-only diagnostics for
  `source=loop`, and raw `ccb agent add --window`, `--window-class`, tmux,
  reload, and kill remain forbidden. Focused RolePack tests passed with
  `8 passed`; related orchestrator/loop/layout/lifecycle tests passed with
  `49 passed`; and a source-wrapper prepare/config/capacity smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/orchestrator-capacity-rolepack-projection-1782560`
  proved config validity, planned node placement, layout status
  `loop_agent_count=2`, and release cleanup back to `loop_agent_count=0`.
- Extended loop-capacity explicit `[windows]` coverage from one execution node
  to multiple node windows. Focused tests now prove `worker=2` and
  `code_reviewer=2` become `node-round2-node1` and `node-round2-node2`, that
  each node keeps its worker/checker order, that release removes both node
  windows from the effective layout, and that `layout status` returns to
  `loop_agent_count=0`. Related targeted tests passed with `50 passed`; the
  mounted fake-provider source-wrapper smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/multi-node-layout-smoke-1782561` proved live
  `add_window` materialization to 8 tmux panes, ask submission to two generated
  loop agents, `remove_agent` release of all four loop agents, and return to
  the original `main` window with only sidebar plus `orchestrator`.
- Extended same-window dynamic release coverage for middle-pane deletion.
  Dynamic lifecycle tests now prove `main + helper1 + helper2 + helper3`
  can unload middle `helper2` while preserving effective order
  `main + helper1 + helper3` and staying in safe `remove_agent` instead of
  degrading to `layout_change`. The mounted fake-provider smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/same-window-middle-release-1782562` proved
  live append-only hot load to panes `%2/%3/%4`, middle release removing only
  `%3`, preserved helper panes `%2` and `%4` staying alive, and accepted asks
  to both surviving dynamic agents after release.
- Landed the first real remove-path reflow slice. `remove_agent` now records
  `reflowed_windows` / `reflow_errors`, runs best-effort `select-layout -E`
  after successful same-window pane removal, and reapplies topology sidebar
  widths so visual compaction does not permanently flatten CCB sidebars.
  Focused tests prove pane-only removal, reflow diagnostics, and sidebar width
  restoration; the repeatable source-wrapper smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/dynamic-layout-reflow-1782570-same-window`
  proved middle `helper2` removal reports `namespace_reflowed_windows=["main"]`
  while preserving `helper1` and `helper3` and keeping survivor asks reachable.
- Hardened the orchestrator autonomous smoke harness so a round is only
  accepted after capacity release and layout cleanup both pass. The harness now
  captures `ccb layout status --json` after the parent callback chain and
  requires `layout_status=ok` with `loop_agent_count=0`, preventing a false
  pass when generated loop agents are released from capacity state but still
  visible in runtime layout. Source-wrapper prepare/config validation passed in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/orchestrator-capacity-layout-prepare-1782571`,
  and the fake workflow closure smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/workflow-closure-layout-1782571` proved
  dynamic generated agents release with no `ps` residue.
- Extended the repeatable dynamic layout smoke to explicit workflow windows.
  The new `window_class_middle_release` flow creates `main` plus
  `plan-orchestrate`, hot-loads `planner_helper1/2/3` with
  `--window-class plan-orchestrate`, removes the middle helper, and proves
  `namespace_reflowed_windows=["plan-orchestrate"]` while preserving surviving
  pane ids and ask reachability. The source-wrapper run in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/dynamic-layout-window-class-1782560319-window-class`
  passed with all three dynamic layout flows green.
- Parameterized the dynamic layout smoke harness for the next real-provider
  slice. It now supports `--provider`, repeatable `--flow`,
  `--provider-home-mode`, and `--prepare-only`, while requiring
  `CCB_DYNAMIC_LAYOUT_SMOKE_RUN_REAL=1` before any non-fake provider is
  started. Default fake-provider regression still passed all three flows, a
  selected `--flow window-class` source-wrapper run passed, and Codex
  `--prepare-only --provider-home-mode real-home` proved executable/auth
  preflight without launching provider panes.
- Integrated the dynamic layout line with remote `origin/main`/`v7.7.0`
  runtime-accelerator and theme changes. Conflict-surface tests passed with
  `105 passed`, dynamic layout regression passed with `101 passed`, runtime
  accelerator focused checks passed, and the merged source-wrapper smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/dynamic-layout-merged-1782561461-*` kept all
  three fake-provider layout flows green.
- Ran the first guarded real-provider explicit-window smoke:
  `CCB_DYNAMIC_LAYOUT_SMOKE_RUN_REAL=1 ... --provider codex --flow
  window-class --provider-home-mode real-home --command-timeout 240`.
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/dynamic-layout-codex-window-1782561840-window-class`
  passed: `frontdesk` and `planner` Codex panes started, three Codex helper
  agents hot-loaded into `plan-orchestrate`, middle `planner_helper2` unloaded
  with `namespace_reflowed_windows=["plan-orchestrate"]`, surviving helper pane
  ids were preserved, and asks to both surviving helpers were accepted.
- Ran the matching guarded Claude real-provider explicit-window smoke:
  `CCB_DYNAMIC_LAYOUT_SMOKE_RUN_REAL=1 ... --provider claude --flow
  window-class --provider-home-mode real-home --command-timeout 300`.
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/dynamic-layout-claude-window-1782563057-window-class`
  passed with `frontdesk` and `planner` Claude panes, three Claude helper panes
  hot-loaded into `plan-orchestrate`, middle `planner_helper2` unloaded with
  `namespace_reflowed_windows=["plan-orchestrate"]`, surviving pane ids
  preserved, asks accepted to `planner_helper1` and `planner_helper3`, and
  final `kill -f` returning `state: unmounted`.
- Strengthened `ccb layout status --json` as a script-facing diagnostic for
  dynamic orchestration. Each agent record now exposes `agent_kind`,
  `ownership_class`, `dispatch_state`, `pane_identity_source`, `apply_status`,
  `apply_plan_class`, `apply_stage`, `failed_apply`, and `retained_busy`, so
  orchestrator scripts can distinguish static configured panes, dynamic
  helpers, loop capacity agents, parked/dispatch-disabled nodes, and failed
  apply attempts without reading raw lifecycle files. Focused regression passed
  with `104 passed`, and a fake `--flow window-class` source-wrapper smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/dynamic-layout-status-diag-1782564247-window-class`
  stayed green.
- Mirrored the same ownership/apply vocabulary into `ccb agent status --json`
  and `ccb agent show --json`, keeping command-level lifecycle diagnostics
  aligned with `layout status --json`. Focused lifecycle/layout tests passed
  with `25 passed`; the broader dynamic lifecycle regression stayed at
  `104 passed`, and another fake explicit-window smoke in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/dynamic-layout-status-helper-1782565815-window-class`
  stayed green.

## Next

1. Package the script-friendly command surface into a
   `dynamic-agent-lifecycle` skill and make orchestrator usage prefer
   `layout status --json` / `agent status --json` over raw daemon internals.
2. Promote the repeatable workflow closure smoke and the autonomous
   layout-cleanup gate into the standard guarded regression path once the
   release gate shape is selected.
3. Package the `dynamic-agent-lifecycle` skill and update
   `orchestrator-capacity` to share the same lifecycle semantics.
4. Define the V1 runtime layout manager command/state surface from
   [topics/dynamic-window-pane-agent-maintenance.md](topics/dynamic-window-pane-agent-maintenance.md):
   expose a script-friendly placement command/skill wrapper for generic
   non-loop dynamic agents while keeping loop execution capacity behind
   `ccb loop capacity`.
5. Implement the next true hot-load slices:
    extend pane-identity diagnostics into startup/mount reports, add standard
    regression entrypoints for the guarded provider smokes, and only later
    richer live reflow beyond the proven same-window and explicit-window-class
    middle-removal cases.
6. Wire the verified deterministic layout planner and dynamic smoke behavior
   into live dynamic capacity only after `layout status` can read current pane
   metadata and release can distinguish idle from busy agents.
7. Land live dynamic pane shrink/release from
   [goals/dynamic-pane-shrink-release-goal.md](goals/dynamic-pane-shrink-release-goal.md):
   busy-retain behavior, idle target release, same-window compaction, and
   overflow-window collapse without respawning surviving provider panes.
8. Define the minimum `ccb loop`, `ccb plan`, and `ccb question` command
   surface for creating tasks, transitioning phases, recording artifacts,
   blocking, finishing, and syncing to plan-tree.
9. Continue the V1 `ccb loop capacity` path selected in
   [goals/orchestrator-dynamic-capacity-goal.md](goals/orchestrator-dynamic-capacity-goal.md):
   run the guarded real-provider semantic smoke for
   `agentroles.ccb_orchestrator` when real provider usage is intentionally
   allowed; daemon-side transient capacity ownership remains deferred.
10. Define the v1 team spec format for planner group, orchestrator, execution
   node, recovery node, and monitor behavior.
11. Define context-purity budgets for each role, including what may enter
   `frontdesk`, planner group, orchestrator, execution nodes, monitor, runtime
   artifacts, and long-term plan-tree.
12. Define the v1 clarification command surface and artifact schema for
   candidate questions, broker review, user display, raw answers, normalized
   answers, deferred questions, and planner wakeup.
13. Define the v1 execution-node and round-verification artifact schemas,
   including node check plans, non-convergence reports, branch freeze records,
   partial loop reports, verification contracts, and round verification plans.
14. Map the design to existing CCB communication primitives: `ask`,
   `--callback`, `--silence`, message bureau records, dispatcher jobs,
   completion state, and queue/trace diagnostics.
15. Identify the first implementation slice that can run with one planner, one
   orchestrator, one execution node, and deterministic monitoring before
   enabling dynamic multi-node fanout.

## V1 Readiness Blockers

1. The authoritative state writer must be scripted before multiple agents are
   allowed to chain transitions.
2. Ready task to execution round binding must have per-task lock/lease
   protection and idempotent round-result import.
3. The full loop runner must have bounded termination and escalation
   conditions before multi-round dynamic execution nodes are enabled.
4. The inner monitor must be split into deterministic health checks and
   optional semantic assessment before it can be trusted to escalate reliably.
5. The plan-tree synchronization policy must prevent high-frequency loop noise
   from entering committed Markdown.
6. The ask/callback handoff contract must define how a child result advances
   loop state without being mistaken for new upstream work.
7. The execution state model must distinguish node status, branch status, and
   round status before parallel node execution is enabled.
8. Dynamic window/pane placement must be tracked in runtime state before CCB
   can safely load many visible dialog, planning, and execution agents without
   cluttering or losing panes.
