## Purpose

This is the second-phase plan for the CCB-managed Neovim tool window. The
first phase made `ccb-nvim` installable, isolated, and safe. This phase should
make it a useful cross-platform editor profile across Linux, macOS, and WSL
without weakening the tool-window and profile-isolation decisions.

## Current Inventory

Implemented behavior observed in source:

- `lib/cli/tools_runtime/neovim.py` creates an isolated `ccb-nvim` wrapper with
  CCB-owned XDG paths and `NVIM_APPNAME=nvim`.
- The wrapper uses a managed Neovim binary when no system `nvim` exists, or a
  system `nvim` when available.
- Managed binary download currently maps Linux x86_64/aarch64 and macOS
  arm64/x86_64 to official Neovim release tarballs and verifies sha256 before
  activation.
- The managed LazyVim profile writes a CCB-owned `init.lua` and
  `lua/plugins/ccb-terminal-compat.lua`.
- The compatibility overlay defaults icon-heavy LazyVim surfaces to ASCII-safe
  output unless `CCB_LAZYVIM_ICON_STYLE=glyph` is set.
- Tests cover isolation from `~/.config/nvim`, LazyVim repair and tarball
  fallback, missing-network degradation, Linux x86_64 managed binary download,
  checksum mismatch, and doctor routing.

Gaps for this phase:

- WSL is not modeled as a distinct Neovim capability surface.
- `ccb tools doctor neovim` does not yet report clipboard, opener,
  terminal-image, WSL, ImageMagick, browser preview, or mounted-drive
  performance risks.
- The default profile does not yet define a stable CCB contract for directory
  browsing, Markdown rendering/preview, image viewing, pasted images, or
  external file opening.
- Rich features are terminal and dependency sensitive; enabling them blindly
  would create broken first-run behavior on some Linux, macOS, tmux, and WSL
  setups.
- Plugin drift remains possible because the CCB profile follows upstream
  LazyVim/lazy.nvim behavior rather than a CCB-owned lockfile.

## Capability Check: 2026-06-13 Linux/X11/tmux

Environment:

- Source validation wrapper:
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/ccb_test --diagnose` from
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2` reports the source wrapper is active and the
  test project is outside the source checkout.
- Platform: Linux x86_64, X11, inside CCB-managed tmux with
  `TERM=tmux-256color` and `COLORTERM=truecolor`.
- Not WSL in this run: `WSL_DISTRO_NAME` and `WSL_INTEROP` were empty.

Observed source-side doctor with isolated source home:

- `HOME=/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/source_home`
  `CCB_SOURCE_HOME=/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/source_home`
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/ccb_test tools doctor neovim`
  reported `neovim_status: missing`.
- The same doctor found `/usr/bin/nvim`, but no isolated `ccb-nvim` wrapper in
  that source test home.

Observed installed user profile:

- `ccb tools doctor neovim` reported `neovim_status: ok`,
  `lazyvim_sync_status: ok`, and `lazyvim_health_status: ok`.
- The wrapper launches `/usr/bin/nvim`, observed as `NVIM v0.12.0-dev`.
- The generated managed profile currently contains only:
  - `init.lua`;
  - `lazy-lock.json`;
  - `lazyvim.json`;
  - `lua/plugins/ccb-terminal-compat.lua`.
- Installed plugin directories include `LazyVim`, `snacks.nvim`,
  `nvim-treesitter`, `mini.icons`, and other LazyVim base plugins.
- Installed plugin directories do not include `render-markdown.nvim`,
  `markdown-preview.nvim`, `img-clip.nvim`, `image.nvim`, `oil.nvim`, or a
  CCB-specific open/files/markdown/images/clipboard overlay.

Folder capability:

- `require("snacks")` succeeds.
- `snacks.explorer`, `snacks.image`, and `snacks.picker` are present.
- Opening `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2` with `ccb-nvim --headless <dir>`
  landed in a `snacks_picker_list` buffer. This confirms the current profile
  has basic Snacks directory handling, but doctor does not report this surface.

Markdown capability:

- Markdown filetype detection works for `.md`.
- `render-markdown.nvim` is not installed, so the stronger in-buffer Markdown
  rendering target is absent.
- A direct Treesitter parser start for `markdown` and `markdown_inline` failed
  in this profile. The probe emitted nvim-treesitter parser download messages,
  which means naive headless checks can mutate or attempt to repair the
  profile.
- Future doctor checks for parser capability must be explicitly read-only, or
  clearly separated from an install/repair command.

Image capability:

- `snacks.image.supports_file()` reports `true` for PNG, JPG, and PDF filename
  extensions in the installed Snacks config, but terminal support is the
  limiting factor.
- `snacks.image.supports_terminal()` returned `false` in this tmux environment.
- Snacks detected the current image terminal environment as `tmux`; Kitty,
  Ghostty, and WezTerm candidates were not detected through the current tmux
  session even though `wezterm` exists on `PATH`.
- `convert`, `gs`, `pdflatex`, and `wezterm` exist. `magick`, `kitty`,
  `ghostty`, `tectonic`, and `mmdc` are missing.
- In this environment, inline images should be marked degraded/unavailable and
  image paths should fall back to external open or reveal-in-explorer.

External opener and clipboard capability:

- Neovim has `vim.ui.open()` and `vim.system()`.
- `xdg-open` is available. `wslview` and `explorer.exe` are not available in
  this non-WSL run.
- `xclip` is available. `wl-copy`, `wl-paste`, `pbcopy`, `pbpaste`,
  `clip.exe`, and `win32yank.exe` are not available.
- Neovim `clipboard` option was empty in the current CCB profile, so the
  profile does not explicitly wire system clipboard behavior even though a
  Linux helper exists.

Immediate implications:

- Directory opening is already good enough to keep Snacks as the default
  baseline, but doctor should expose it.
- Markdown is not yet good enough for the user's target; add
  `render-markdown.nvim` plus parser readiness reporting.
- Inline images must be capability-gated. Current Linux/tmux evidence supports
  external fallback as the default behavior when terminal detection fails.
- Capability probes must not accidentally trigger parser/plugin installation
  during `doctor`; read-only detection needs its own implementation path.

## Goals

- Preserve the existing isolation contract: no writes to user
  `~/.config/nvim`, default Neovim data/cache/state, or global tmux config.
- Make `ccb-nvim` a predictable editing tool window for common project work:
  open folders, inspect files, write Markdown, view Markdown enough to edit,
  open images or image references when the platform supports it, and open
  files/URLs through the system handler.
- Treat cross-platform behavior as capability-gated. Unsupported capabilities
  should show as `skipped` or `degraded` in doctor output, not as broken Neovim
  startup.
- Keep tool windows out of ask routing, provider runtime, Comms, completion
  tracking, and agent health authority.
- Make source validation repeatable through the existing
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/ccb_test` plus `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2`
  discipline.

## User Intent Update

The default managed profile should be strong enough to serve as a real project
editor, not only a proof that LazyVim starts. At minimum it must open folders
well and make Markdown and image-heavy project files easier to inspect.

This shifts the target from "optional Neovim tool window" to "safe default
project editor profile with capability-gated rich features."

## Non-Goals

- Native Windows support outside WSL.
- Replacing a user's personal Neovim configuration.
- Turning the Neovim tool window into an agent or ask target.
- Requiring Nerd Fonts, Node.js, browser tooling, ImageMagick, or a specific
  terminal for the profile to start.
- Bundling every plugin or every Neovim release binary directly into CCB
  release artifacts.

## Compatibility Model

### Core Editor

This layer must work everywhere CCB supports the Neovim tool:

- compatible `nvim` binary resolution;
- isolated XDG paths;
- LazyVim bootstrap and health check;
- true-color environment;
- tmux focus and escape-time compatibility;
- ASCII-safe UI by default.

### OS Integration

This layer is platform dependent and should be diagnosed separately:

- system opener for files and URLs:
  - Linux: `xdg-open` or desktop-specific equivalent;
  - macOS: `open`;
  - WSL: `wslview`, `explorer.exe`, or another explicit bridge;
- clipboard:
  - Linux X11/Wayland helpers such as `xclip` or `wl-clipboard`;
  - macOS helpers such as `pbcopy`/`pbpaste` and plugin-specific tools;
  - WSL helpers such as Linux clipboard tools, OSC52, `clip.exe`, or an
    explicitly configured bridge.

### Rich Media

This layer should never be assumed:

- terminal image protocol support varies by terminal and tmux passthrough;
- ImageMagick is needed for many non-PNG conversions;
- inline media can fail in WSL, nested tmux, SSH, or terminals without image
  protocol support;
- Markdown browser preview may need a browser, Node-based build steps, or a
  desktop opener.

## Proposed Profile Shape

Keep the current managed `init.lua`, but split the generated overlay into
small CCB-owned plugin modules so doctor output and tests can reason about each
surface:

- `ccb-terminal-compat.lua`: existing ASCII icons, fillchars, true-color, and
  terminal-safe LazyVim defaults.
- `ccb-open.lua`: keymaps and helpers around Neovim's system open behavior,
  with WSL-specific opener selection handled by CCB capability detection.
- `ccb-files.lua`: one default folder workflow. Prefer a single default file
  manager path instead of enabling multiple competing explorers.
- `ccb-markdown.lua`: in-buffer Markdown rendering as the default, with browser
  preview as optional capability-gated functionality.
- `ccb-images.lua`: inline/image preview only when terminal protocol and
  conversion dependencies pass capability checks.
- `ccb-clipboard.lua`: paste image and clipboard helper integration only when
  platform support is explicit.

Candidate defaults to evaluate:

- Folder workflow: prefer `snacks.nvim` explorer for the CCB default because it
  is already part of the LazyVim/Snacks direction, can replace netrw for
  directory arguments, and provides file operations without adding another
  primary explorer. Keep `oil.nvim` as a future optional power-user overlay
  rather than the default.
- Markdown workflow: enable in-buffer rendering by default with
  `render-markdown.nvim`. Browser preview remains optional and
  capability-gated because it adds heavier browser/runtime assumptions.
- Image workflow: use `snacks.image` as the default inline image path when its
  own terminal/file support checks pass, with a clean fallback to external open
  through the platform opener.
- Image paste workflow: keep paste-from-clipboard optional until clipboard
  helper detection is reliable across Linux, macOS, tmux, and WSL.

## Recommended Baseline Stack

Folder and project navigation:

- Enable Snacks explorer and picker in the generated CCB profile.
- Set explorer replacement for netrw so `ccb-nvim .` and opening a directory
  inside Neovim produce an explorer instead of an empty or confusing buffer.
- Keep keypaths aligned with LazyVim conventions:
  - `<leader>e`: project/root explorer;
  - `<leader>E`: current working directory explorer;
  - `<leader><space>` or existing LazyVim picker key: find files.
- Doctor should verify that opening a directory does not fall back to netrw or
  fail before the profile is considered fully healthy.

Markdown:

- Add `MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim` to the managed profile and
  configure it with ASCII-safe headings/checkmarks when
  `CCB_LAZYVIM_ICON_STYLE` is not `glyph`.
- Ensure Treesitter parsers needed for Markdown rendering are available or
  clearly reported as degraded. The profile should remain usable even if parser
  installation fails.
- Keep `markdown-preview.nvim` out of the first default slice. Add it later
  only when doctor can report browser/opener/runtime readiness.

Images:

- Enable `snacks.image` only behind capability checks:
  - terminal supports the Kitty graphics protocol path used by Snacks;
  - tmux passthrough is available or the session is not inside tmux;
  - ImageMagick is available when non-PNG conversion is needed.
- For unsupported terminals or WSL cases, provide explicit fallback commands:
  - open image or Markdown image target externally;
  - reveal the path in the explorer;
  - report why inline rendering is unavailable.
- Avoid treating inline image failure as LazyVim profile failure. It should
  degrade the image surface only.

External open:

- Use Neovim's system-open behavior as the common path, but let CCB doctor
  diagnose the effective opener:
  - Linux: `xdg-open`;
  - macOS: `open`;
  - WSL: `wslview`, `explorer.exe`, or configured fallback.
- Add a managed keymap for opening the current file and for opening a file/URL
  under cursor, while keeping normal editing behavior intact.

## Why Not Default To Oil First

`oil.nvim` is a good project and remains a strong option, but it creates a
second primary file-management model beside LazyVim/Snacks. For a managed
default profile, the lower-risk path is to make the existing LazyVim/Snacks
stack coherent before adding another explorer. If users later need
buffer-style filesystem editing, it can be added as an optional overlay without
changing the default folder-open contract.

## Implementation Slices

1. Capability diagnostics foundation:
   - detect platform, WSL, terminal program, tmux passthrough readiness,
     opener, clipboard helper, ImageMagick, and optional browser/Node support;
   - add machine-readable keys to `ccb tools doctor neovim`, for example
     `opener_status`, `clipboard_status`, `image_status`,
     `markdown_preview_status`, and `wsl_status`;
   - add unit tests with mocked platform/env/path states before enabling new
     profile features.
2. Profile overlay modularization:
   - split the generated compatibility overlay into stable CCB-owned modules;
   - keep existing ASCII behavior and marker checks;
   - preserve user override paths and never overwrite non-managed files.
3. Folder baseline:
   - enable Snacks explorer/picker as the default directory workflow;
   - verify `ccb-nvim .`, opening a directory path, and `<leader>e` open folders
     predictably inside the tool window.
4. Markdown baseline:
   - enable in-buffer Markdown viewing with `render-markdown.nvim` when
     parser/plugin state is healthy;
   - keep browser preview optional and diagnosable.
5. Image and media baseline:
   - gate `snacks.image` inline support on terminal protocol, tmux passthrough,
     and conversion helper readiness;
   - fall back to external open when inline rendering is unavailable.
6. WSL-specific behavior:
   - detect WSL separately from generic Linux;
   - warn when tool data/cache/state are placed on a mounted Windows drive if
     that causes known performance or execution problems;
   - choose an opener and clipboard fallback policy that aligns with the WSL
     compatibility plan's artifact/authority separation.
7. Validation and rollout:
   - expand unit tests for Linux, macOS, WSL, missing helper, and helper-present
     capability states;
   - run live validation from `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2`;
   - record Linux, macOS, WSL home, and WSL `/mnt/<drive>` manual results in
     the test matrix or issue log.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `ccb tools doctor neovim` explains which advanced surfaces are available,
  skipped, or degraded without mutating state.
- `ccb tools install neovim` remains optional by default and required only when
  `CCB_INSTALL_NEOVIM=1`.
- A fresh managed profile can open a project folder and edit normal source
  files on Linux, macOS, WSL home, and WSL mounted-drive projects.
- Markdown files are readable in the managed profile without requiring a
  browser.
- Image references either render inline when capabilities pass or open through
  a diagnosed external fallback.
- Missing image, clipboard, browser, or terminal-image dependencies do not
  break Neovim startup.
- No test or live validation writes user `~/.config/nvim`, default Neovim
  data/cache/state, or global `~/.tmux.conf`.
- Tool-window add/remove reload still leaves unrelated agent panes and `ccb ask`
  routing intact.

## Risks

- LazyVim and plugin upstream drift can break generated overlay assumptions.
- Terminal image protocol support differs across Kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm, tmux,
  SSH, and WSL terminals.
- WSL may have multiple plausible clipboard/opener paths, and choosing the
  wrong one can make behavior appear flaky.
- Rich Markdown preview can pull in browser and Node dependencies that are too
  heavy for a default profile.
- Mounted Windows drives can be slower or have different execution semantics,
  even when the Neovim profile itself lives under a Linux XDG root.

## Readiness

Not implementation-ready yet. The next planning step is to make explicit
decisions for:

- default folder workflow;
- default versus opt-in rich media behavior;
- plugin pinning or upstream-follow policy;
- WSL opener and clipboard fallback order.
